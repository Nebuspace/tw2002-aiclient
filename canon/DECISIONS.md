# DECISIONS — Open Questions

<!--
This is the open-questions workspace. It is the first stop when Samantha (or Monk)
hits a canon edge: a Gap (no canon covers it), a Conflict (action would contradict canon),
or a Change (canon itself appears wrong or stale).

LIFECYCLE:
1. Log the question here (OPEN) — do not stall; build the unambiguous kernel and continue.
2. Samantha drives the discussion with the human.
3. Human resolves → mark RESOLVED, draft an ADR if the resolution is durable.
4. Ratified ADR → entry here moves to CLOSED; canon is updated; the leash grows.

RULES:
- Append-only within each item once logged. Never delete or overwrite an open item.
- The human is the only one who can mark something RESOLVED or CLOSED.
- A DECISION logged here is NOT yet canon — act on the unambiguous kernel only.
- Items stale beyond 2 sprint cycles → flag to the human for triage.

### OPEN-001 — One package tree vs. the Phase-0 two-top-level-package scaffold

**Filed:** 2026-07-23
**Filed by:** Monk (via orchestrator WO-ADR-001-ONE-TREE)
**Edge type:** Change

**Question:**
WO-P0-003 stood up two sibling top-level packages (`tw2002_aiclient/` product TUI + `twclient/`
daemon-core) reading the session-engine's two-*process* split as a two-*package* split. Max ruled
this wrong for greenfield: the codebase should live under one importable tree
(`tw2002_aiclient/`, with the daemon-core relocated to `tw2002_aiclient/session/`), while the
2–3-process runtime split (`twd` / `tw` / the TUI app) stays exactly as canon already specifies.
Is this ruling ready to accept as ADR-001, and — separately — does the aiclient app's on-exit
"stop the daemon too?" confirm popup default to **Yes** or **No**?

**Why it matters:**
Every future daemon-core WO (WO-P2-020 through WO-P2-028 and beyond) currently targets `twclient/*`
import paths. Left unresolved, new work keeps building against the wrong packaging shape, growing
the relocation's blast radius the longer Accept is deferred.

**Options considered:**
A) Accept ADR-001 as drafted (one tree, `session/` subpackage name, exit-popup default TBD) and
   schedule the relocate WO immediately after Accept.
B) Accept the one-tree decision but rename the subpackage `engine/` instead of `session/`.
C) Leave the two-package scaffold as-is (rejected by Max's ruling; recorded here only as the
   status-quo alternative).

**Unambiguous kernel built while waiting:**
This DECISION, ADR-001 (Proposed, not self-Accepted), and the canon fold in
`canon/architecture/session-engine.md`, `canon/surfaces/trainer-cockpit.md`, and
`canon/surfaces/entry-and-profile-selection.md` — all citing ADR-001 as "Proposed; pending Accept."
No product code was written and no package was relocated; that work is explicitly deferred to a
follow-on WO listed in ADR-001's Consequences, gated on Accept.

## RESOLVED

<!-- Items with a human decision on record. Waiting for ADR drafting or already captured. -->

<!-- (empty — nothing resolved yet) -->

---

## CLOSED

<!-- Items fully absorbed into canon (ADR accepted + canon updated). Safe to archive. -->

<!-- (empty until first item completes the full loop) -->
